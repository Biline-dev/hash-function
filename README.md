# hash-function
`hash1.h` contains all the functions needed to use arrays.  
`hash2.h` contains all the functions needed to use files.  
`hash3.h` contains the hash function and the padding.

I opted for a method where I studied the file which contains more than 86000 words `dictionary.txt`, I divided it on intervals according to the length of the word in order to adapt my function to these conditions and to minimize the number of collisions.
